         Some splinters of the sword was found and used by Talco the slayer who managed to use it to cut his way through the kingdom of the giants and slayed their king.
         The main part of the sword was never found.

         promising that the Vokstriders would be rewarded a part of that land. The Vokstriders agreed and mass produced Vasiria vokstrider blades that came to be known as Vasiria's justice.
